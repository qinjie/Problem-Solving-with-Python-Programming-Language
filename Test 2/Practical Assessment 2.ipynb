    "### Question 3: Card Game\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard 52-card deck includes 13 ranks in each of the four suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. In the game for this question, only **ranks** are used, whereas **suits** are ignored. You will defines two classes `Game` and `Player` to simulate this game. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>How the Game Works:</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the beginning of the game, each player receives the same number of random cards from the deck in a particular order. Players are not allowed to change the order of cards in their hand from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When it is a player's turn, he plays his **right-most** card onto the table. Newly played cards are stacked on top of existing cards on the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Cards on the table are kept in a single stack with older cards at the bottom and newer ones on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In either of following scenarios, the player takes some or all of the cards from the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If the player plays a card with rank \"J\", the player takes all the cards on the table.\n",
    "    * If the player plays a card with rank equal to another card on the table, the player takes all the cards between the two cards, including the two cards of same rank. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When player takes cards from the table, those cards are added to the **left** of player's existing cards. The order of the added cards must not be changed (i.e., the bottom-most card that was taken becomes the player's new left-most card).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The game ends when one player has no more cards. The player with the most cards wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Game Example:</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the existing cards on the table are `[2, 6, 'A', 4, 9]`, where `2` is the oldest card and `9` is the most recently played card. \n",
    "* <u>Example 1:</u> Player A plays card `7`. He doesn't get to take any cards off the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"raw/eg1.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "* <u>Example 2:</u> Player B then plays card `9`. He gets to take three cards `[9, 7, 9]` and adds them to the left of his existing cards. Remaining cards on table are `[2, 6, 'A', 4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"raw/eg2.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "* <u>Example 3:</u> Player C then plays card `6`. He gets to take four cards `[6, 'A', 4, 6]`. Remaining card on table is `[2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"raw/eg3.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "* <u>Example 4:</u> Player D then plays card `J`, which is a special card. He takes all cards on the table, i.e. `[2, 'J']`. There are no more cards on the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"raw/eg4.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Player Example:</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "When a player plays a card, he removes his *right-most* card from the card list. \n",
    "* For example, if player has cards `[3, 4, 2]`, card `2` will be the next card to be played. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a player takes cards from the table, he adds them to the *left* side of his card list.\n",
    "* For example, if the cards he takes from the table are `[6, 'A', 4, 9, 6]` and his existing cards are `[3, 4, 2]`, the combined cards will be `[6, 'A', 4, 9, 6, 3, 4, 2]`\n"
