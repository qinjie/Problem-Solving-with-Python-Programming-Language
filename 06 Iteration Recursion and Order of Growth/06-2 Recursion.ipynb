    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.\n",
    "* A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion.\n",
    "* Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration.\n",

    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sometimes the logic behind recursion is hard to follow through.\n",
    "* Recursive functions are hard to debug.\n",
    "* Recursive calls are expensive (inefficient) as they take up a lot of memory and time.\n",
