    "# Debugging using pdb\n",
    "\n",
    "Code debugging is an important skill for software developer. Python provides an interactive source code debugger `pdb`. It is part of Pythonâ€™s standard library, which is always there and available for use.Such debugger is useful to track down hard-to-find bugs and make code fix more quickly and reliably.\n",
